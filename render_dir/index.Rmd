# Welcome

This book is a collection of Rmarkdown documents that contain data analyses I have done in day-to-day work. The book is written using [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/), and there is a very useful bookdown reference book [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).

## Getting started

Many different R packages are used in this book, if you would like to install some them run:


```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr", "data.table",
                   "shiny", "plotly", "bookdown", "RColorBrewer",
                   "d3heatmap", "devtools", "ggvis", "tidyr"))
```

[Bioconductor](www.bioconductor.org) is also very useful.


```r
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite()
```
